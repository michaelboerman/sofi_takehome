### Questions

1. It sounds like the bank is implementing a new fraud model score from a vendor, and this is *not* replacing an existing model score. Iâ€™d like clarification on if the bank has *any* existing fraud modelling (such that this is fitting into an existing suite of models and infrastructure) or if this is the *first* fraud model the bank is implementing (such that this is stand-alone and the fraud detection process itself is novel)
